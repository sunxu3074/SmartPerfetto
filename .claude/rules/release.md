# Release Rules

Read this file before any publish, package, tag, release, npm, Docker, or
portable artifact task.

## Release Surfaces

SmartPerfetto has separate release surfaces. Do not assume one successful
surface proves the others.

| Surface | Artifact | User entry | Includes | Does not include |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| npm CLI | `@gracker/smartperfetto` | `smp`, `smartperfetto` | CLI dist, backend runtime assets, Skills, Strategies, SQL, packaged `trace_processor_shell` prebuilts for supported targets | Web UI launcher, Docker image, portable app bundle |
| GitHub portable | `smartperfetto-v<version>-windows-x64.zip`, `smartperfetto-v<version>-macos-arm64.zip`, `smartperfetto-v<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz` | bundled launcher | Node.js 24 runtime, native production dependencies, backend, committed `frontend/`, pinned `trace_processor_shell` | npm global install |
| Docker Hub | Linux container image from `main` workflow | `docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml up -d` | backend, committed `frontend/`, pinned trace processor, Docker volumes | host Claude Code local auth |
| Source checkout | Git repository | `./start.sh` | backend source, committed `frontend/`, optional `perfetto/` submodule for UI development | published artifact guarantees |

The npm CLI requires user-provided Node.js `>=24 <25`. Portable packages bundle
Node.js 24. Docker users do not need host Node.js. Native Windows source work
should use WSL2; native Windows users should use the portable package.

## Version Source

- Root `package.json` is the project version source.
- `npm run version:set -- <version>` must synchronize:
  - `package.json`
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `backend/package.json`
  - `backend/package-lock.json`
- Verify with `npm run version:sync -- --check`.
- Published npm versions are immutable. If a release bug escapes, fix it,
  bump the next patch version, publish a new npm version, and supersede the
  GitHub release instead of mutating the published version.

## Public Release Sequence

1. Fetch and inspect current state:
   - `git status --short --branch`
   - `git fetch --tags origin`
   - `npm view @gracker/smartperfetto version --json`
   - `gh release view v<version>` when checking an existing release
2. Start from a clean, up-to-date `main`.
3. Confirm Node.js 24 is active. Do not publish from Node 25.
4. Run the verification tier that matches the change. For release-process,
   portable, CLI packaging, runtime asset, or version-sync changes, follow
   `.claude/rules/testing.md`.
5. Bump and commit the version:
   ```bash
   npm run version:set -- <version>
   npm run version:sync -- --check
   git add package.json package-lock.json backend/package.json backend/package-lock.json
   git commit -m "chore: release v<version>"
   git push origin main
   ```
6. Publish the npm CLI:
   ```bash
   npm whoami
   npm --prefix backend run cli:pack-check
   cd backend
   npm publish --access public
   cd ..
   npm view @gracker/smartperfetto version --json
   ```
   For a new scope or org, verify scope permission first. Publishing can
   return success before registry metadata is fully visible; wait and verify
   both `npm view` and an isolated install before calling the npm release done.
   Do not use `npm --prefix backend publish --access public`: npm can still
   resolve the publish target as the repository root package, hit the root
   `private` guard, and fail with `EPRIVATE` without publishing
   `@gracker/smartperfetto`.
7. Run isolated npm smoke in a temp directory:
   ```bash
   npm install @gracker/smartperfetto@<version>
   ./node_modules/.bin/smp --version
   ./node_modules/.bin/smartperfetto --help
   ./node_modules/.bin/smp doctor --format json
   ```
8. Build and publish portable GitHub assets:
   ```bash
   npm run package:portable
   npm run release:portable -- <version> --skip-build --no-draft
   gh release view v<version> --json tagName,isDraft,assets
   ```
9. Re-check `git status --short --branch`. Generated `dist/portable/`,
   `dist/windows-exe/`, and cache outputs must not be staged.

## npm CLI Invariants

- `backend/package.json` package name is `@gracker/smartperfetto`.
- The package must expose both `smp` and `smartperfetto` bins.
- `npm --prefix backend run cli:pack-check` must verify package contents before
  publish.
- Publish from the `backend/` working directory with `npm publish --access
  public`; do not publish with `npm --prefix backend publish`.
- The packed CLI must contain runtime assets needed by `doctor`, `query`,
  `skill`, `run`, `ask`, `repl`, `compare`, and `report export`.
- Do not publish if dry-run or pack-check reports missing bin files,
  missing runtime assets, wrong version, or an unsupported Node engine.

## Portable Release Invariants

- Asset names and top-level directories must be versioned:
  - `smartperfetto-v<version>-windows-x64.zip`
  - `smartperfetto-v<version>-macos-arm64.zip`
  - `smartperfetto-v<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz`
- Do not publish old unversioned asset names.
- Do not use `--allow-dirty` for public releases.
- `--skip-build` is allowed only when the existing packages were freshly built
  for the exact version and commit being released.
- The package manifest must report `gitDirty: false` and `gitCommit` equal to
  the release target commit.
- macOS releases are ad-hoc signed by default. Public notarized releases need
  `SMARTPERFETTO_MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY` and
  `SMARTPERFETTO_MACOS_NOTARY_PROFILE`.

## Docker Release Notes

Docker Hub images are produced by repository workflow from `main`. When a task
changes Dockerfile, compose files, `frontend/` consumption, trace-processor
setup, provider env behavior, or startup scripts, verify the Docker path and
update Docker docs. Do not describe a manual Docker publish as complete unless
the workflow or image tag is verified.

## Secret Handling

- Never commit npm tokens, provider keys, GitHub tokens, or temporary `.npmrc`
  files.
- Do not echo tokens into logs, docs, commit messages, release notes, or final
  summaries.
- Prefer environment variables or npm's normal auth store for one-off publish
  work.
- If a token was pasted into a chat or terminal transcript, recommend rotation
  after the release is verified.

## Release Bug Policy

- Small documentation or release-note mistakes: fix docs, commit, push.
- Package/runtime bug after npm publish: fix, verify, bump next patch version,
  publish npm again, then publish matching portable assets.
- Major runtime regression: stop promoting the bad version, document the
  blocker, fix with targeted tests, then publish a superseding release.
